description: 'A true explorer and creative, artist Meredith Ochoa has been reinventing alternative and digital processes since 2007. She has developed a portable scanning process in which the subject becomes the "negative" through digital degradation with a portable wand of light. The portable scanner describes the subject through a life-size depiction of the number of pixels the subject amounts to.'
